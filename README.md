Exploring the capabilities of the Muse Headband
============

Flexible, adjustable, lightweight headband with 7 sensors capable of reading 4 channels of data - two on the forehead and two behind the ears 
Produces bipolar readings using Fpz(center of forehead) as the reference for TP9(top of left ear), Fp1(left forehead), Fp2(right forehead), TP10(top of right ear).
1 DRL sensor at Fpz and 2 reference sensors on the forehead.
The 7-sensor montage enables estimation of hemispheric asymmetries (with an emphasis on the pre-frontal lobe) and thus facilitates brain-state discrimination that depends on asymmetry, such as emotional valence (positive vs. negative emotions). 
EEG signals are oversampled and then downsampled to yield an output sampling rate of 220 Hz, with 2uV (RMS) noise. Active noise suppression is achieved with a DRL - REF feedback configuration using centrally positioned frontal sensors. 
Input range of AC coupled signal (low cutoff at 1 Hz) is 2 mV p-p. 
An on-board 3-axis accelerometer enables motion input for games and for quantifying head movements. 
Communicates over Bluetooth and is compatible with iOS (iPhone 4+, iPad 2+, iTouch 5+), Android 2.3+, Mac OS (OSX 10.8+), Windows 7 & 8 and Ubuntu Linux LTS releases. 
Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (charge via micro-USB jack, just like most cell phones). Lasts up to 5 hours of use per charge. Typical lithium-ion batteries last a minimum of 500 charge cycles. Thus if you use Muse for 15 minutes a day the battery should last at least 27 years.
Battery fuel gauge which measures the amount of remaining battery.
5 LEDs which display various states of operation.
